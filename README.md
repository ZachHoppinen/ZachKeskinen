- I am a current PhD candidate at Boise State University studying temperature dynamics in mountain snowpacks, avalanche detection using infrasound, and radar based snow depth retrievals.
- 👀 I’m interested in snow science, radar remote sensing, infrasound, snow physics and avalanche research.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about handling large SAR image datasets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on snow science research!
